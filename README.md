This mod adds hunger, so you have to eat in order to survive. You will have to search for wild plants or eat poisonous biter flesh. You consume more energy when you run, and even more when you have a heavy armor on. The consumption also depends on the grid slots filled.
This mod also adds lots of tech (including new science pack) and achievements. Contains almost 40 different things to eat, including 8 Effect capsules, each with it's own buff. It also offers a green way of producing oil - rapeseed.

## Settings:
- GUI position
- Base energy consumption
- Additional consumption for armor
- Additional consumption for armor grid slots
- Biter flesh removal
