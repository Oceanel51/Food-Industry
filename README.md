This mod adds **hunger**, so you **have to eat** in order to survive. You will have to search for wild plants or eat poisonous biter flesh.
You **consume more Energy** when you run, and even more when you have a armor on and its durability. The consumption also depends on the grid slots filled. Also You consume more Energy when you mining (increase when equiped mining-tool), driving (decreases if you get in the vechicle), picking or repairing (also depends when equiped modular armor).
With the help of new technologies you can increase your **Energy maximum** from 100 to **500** for any needs.
This mod also adds lots of tech (including new science pack) and achievements. Contains almost **40 different things** to eat, including **8 Effect capsules**, each with it's own buff for fun. It also offers a green way of producing oil - rapeseed.

## Settings:
- GUI position
- Base Energy consumption
- Additional consumption for armor
- Additional consumption for armor grid slots
- Biter flesh removal
